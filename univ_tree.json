Today it is a broad-based, research intensive institution ranked in the top 1% of the world's universities. As a member of the prestigious Russell Group of leading UK research universities, Glasgow changes the world with its expertise. Total income for research reached 181 million in 2012-13, placing the University in the UK`s top 10 earners for research. This means that the University`s researchers can make important discoveries, whether that`s finding a way to detect malaria in minutes, or contributing to the biggest particle physics experiment in the world: the Large Hadron Collider. Some of the research being conducted at Glasgow is also award-winning. in 2013, the Boyd Orr Centre for Population & Ecosystem Health was honoured by a prestigious Queens Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education. This research-led approach is one of the reasons why a degree from the University is so prized, but students also benefit from opportunities to study abroad, take part in work experience placements and explore a wide range of social activities in the UK`s first UNESCO City of Music. Each year, Glasgow welcomes around 17,000 undergraduates and 6,000 postgraduates from around 120 countries. Ranked fourth in the UK for international student satisfaction, Glasgow ensures that its students graduate equipped with the skills they need to complete in a global workplace.",

The most recent self-renewal followed the Peaceful Revolution in East Germany in 1989. Many new outstanding professors were appointed from East and West, from at home and from abroad. Thanks to the successful process of restructuring, Humboldt-Universitat is among Germany`s top ten universities in national and international rankings attracting the best students from around the world. Research is conducted on socially relevant topics and pressing future concerns, always striving to find workable solutions and looking for new ways to communicate results to the public.

What is unique about this system is that each school could full fill the needs of a more focused degree in the chosen area of study and at the same time, students could have the opportunity to explore other areas of study offered by another school. The interdisciplinary approach ensures that USM, the first in the country to adopt this system, would produce trained, multi-skilled graduates. USM main campus is located within a tropical island of Penang, Malaysia. There are two USM branch campuses, one at Kubang Kerian in Kelantan known as Health Campus and the other at Nibong Tebal, known as Engineering Campus.
